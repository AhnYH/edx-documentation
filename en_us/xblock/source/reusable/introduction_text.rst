XBlocks are the components that you use to build courseware.

XBlocks are like miniature web applications: they store data, present data, and accept input from learners.
	
Like HTML ``<div>`` tags, XBlocks can represent components as small as a
paragraph of text, a video, or a multiple choice input field, or as large as a
section, a chapter, or an entire course.
