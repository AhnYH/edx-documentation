Install an XBlock
******************

After you create an XBlock, you install it in the XBlock SDK. 

In the ``xblock-sdk`` directory, use ``pip`` to install your XBlock.

   .. code-block:: bash

      pip install -e myxblock

You can then :ref:`test your XBlock <Testing an XBlock with the XBlock SDK>` in
the XBlock SDK.
