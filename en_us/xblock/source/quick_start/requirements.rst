XBlock Development Requirements
################################

To build an XBlock, you must have required background knowledge, described in
this topic. See the following requirements:

* `Git`_
* `A Virtual Environement`_

****
Git
****

EdX repositories, including XBlock and the XBlock SDK, are stored in GitHub. 

To build your own XBlock, and to deploy it later, you must use Git for source
control.

If you do not have Git installed, or are unfamiliar with the tool, see the
`GitHub Help`_.

************************
A Virtual Environement
************************

You develop your XBlock in a Python virtual environment.

The instructions and exaples in this tutorial use `VirtualEnv`_ and
`VirtualEnvWrapper`_ to build XBlocks. You could also use `PyEnv`_.
