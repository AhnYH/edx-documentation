Learning to Use XBlock Software Development Kit
################################################

The XBlock SDK is a Python application you use to help you build new XBlocks.
The XBlock SDK contains three main components:

* An XBlock creation tool that builds the skeleton of a new XBlock.
* An XBlock runtime for viewing and testing your XBlocks during development.
* Sample XBlocks that you can use as the starting point for new XBlocks, and
  for your own learning.

In :ref:`Build an XBlock Quick Start`, you :ref:`set up the XBlock Software
Development Kit (SDK) <Set Up the XBlock Software Development Kit>`. You had to
do this to :ref:`create your first XBlock <Create Your First XBlock>`.

While covering some of the same topics, this part of the tutorial is included
as a later reference for using the XBlock SDK.

If you have completed the quick start instructions, and want to continue
learning about XBlocks, skip to :ref:`Anatomy of an XBlock`.
