Using the XBlock Software Development Kit
##########################################

The XBlock SDK is a Python application you use to help you build new XBlocks. The XBlock SDK contains three main components:

* An XBlock creation tool that builds the skeleton of a new XBlock.
* An XBlock runtime for viewing and testing your XBlocks during development.
* Sample XBlocks that you can use as the starting point for new XBlocks, and
  for your own learning.

In :ref:`Build an XBlock - Quickstart`, you :ref:`set up the XBlock Software
Development Kit (SDK) <Set Up the XBlock Software Development Kit>`. You had to
do this to :ref:`create your first XBlock <Create Your First XBlock>`.

While covering some of the same topics, this part of the tutorial provides more in-depth information on using the XBlock SDK.
