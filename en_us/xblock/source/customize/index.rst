Now that you have created your XBlock, ``myxblock``, you need to make it do
something. This part of the tutorial walks through modifying ``myxblock``;
for practical purposes, we will update it to match the `Thumbs XBlock`_ that is
installed with the XBlock SDK.

The section :ref:`Anatomy of an XBlock` further explains how the Thumbs XBlock
works. The section :ref:`XBlock Concepts` provides information on the different
components of an XBlock.
