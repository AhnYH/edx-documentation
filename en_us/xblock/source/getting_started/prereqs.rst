EdX repositories, including XBlock and the XBlock SDK, are stored in GitHub. 

To build your own XBlock, and to deploy it later, you must use Git for source

If you do not have Git installed, or you are are unfamiliar with the tool, see
the `GitHub Help`_.

You must develop your XBlock in a Python virtual environment.

The instructions and examples in this tutorial use `VirtualEnv`_ and
