The following list describes features that are currently in development and
that edX expects to release in the near future. After these features are
released, we will add a link to related documentation.

* For courses that have fees, organizations will soon be able to purchase
  multiple enrollment codes for learners. The organization will distribute the
  codes to learners, who can then enroll in the course in just one step.
  Organizations must work with edX to purchase these codes.

* Several enhancements to open response assessments (ORA) will soon be available
  in edx.org and edge.edx.org courses. 

    * Course staff will be able to look up learner information using the
      learner's username rather than an anonymized ID.

    * Course staff will be able to cancel specific learner responses and remove
      them from peer assessments.

    * ORA assignments will support multiple prompts.

* Course teams will soon be able to use new component types to include Google
  Calendars and Google Drive documents in courseware.
